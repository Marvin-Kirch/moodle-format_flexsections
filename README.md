# Flexible sections course format

Plugin format_flexsecitons for Moodle LMS.

Allows to organise course content in sections:

- Each section may be displayed on the same page or as a link to a separate page;
- It is possible to nest sections under each other;
- When teacher hides a section all nested sections and activities become hidden as well;
- If a section has both activities and subsections activities are displayed first.

Plugin can be downloaded from https://moodle.org/plugins/format_flexsections
